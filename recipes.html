          <h3>Bread</h3>
          <h4>Ezekial</h4>
          <p>Ezekiel is a sprouted grain bread that can be purchased at health food stores and some supermarkets.  If a sprouted grain bread is not your preference, opt for rye breads or those that do not contain white flour.
          </p>
          <h3>Pancakes</h3>
          <h4>Bananas, Eggs, Chia Seeds</h4>
          <p>
          Mash 3/4 of 1 large banana. Add 2 eggs and combine. Add 1 tbs of chia seeds to help the mixture stay together. (Chia seeds are optional, if you don’t have them the pancakes will still form and taste great!) Heat a frying pan over high heat. Add a dash of olive oil or coconut oil and cook and flip pancakes as usual! Top with a little raw honey, organic yoghurt and the remaining 1/4 of banana. You can also add berries, seeds and nuts to this delicious stack.
          </p>
        <h3>Peanut Butter</h3>
        <h4>Natural Nut Spreads</h4>
        <p>
          Nut spreads can be found at health food stores and supermarkets. Ensure to check the ingredients and don’t be fooled with the health claims that may be found on the front label. The spread should contain no added sugar.

          <h4>Cauliflower, Butter, Cream, Cheddar</h4>

          <h4>Cauliflower, Egg, Olive Oil</h4>
          <p>Pulse half a head of steamed or raw cauliflower, to reach a rice like texture. Place the mixture in a tea towel or cloth and squeeze out as much moisture as possible.
